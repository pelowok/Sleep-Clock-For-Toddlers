Sleep-Clock-For-Toddlers
========================

Toddlers can't read, so they need a different kind of clock to know when it's okay to get out of bed

This clock is meant to run on phones and tablets - I specifically designed it to run on an old android tablet I had lying about, a LePan II.

The clock initially displays the current time and the alarm time, then launches a random number/size/color gradient 'bubble' objects that bounce around.

30 minutes before wake-up time, the bubbles all turn blue. 5 minutes before wake-up, they all turn red. At wake-up, they turn yellow.

Toddlers quickly learn color- and icon-based sleep clocks.

As a note, the Main class object is com.mynameiszak.SleepClock.SleepClock

This project originally (currently?) compiles in Flash Professional.
